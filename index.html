       <p>  The Border Collie is a Northumbrian breed of herding dog of medium size. Widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed,they are descended from landrace sheepdogs once found all over the British Isles, but became standardised in the Anglo-Scottish border region. They are now mostly used as working dogs to herd livestock, specifically sheep.
<br></br>
Border Collies are extremely energetic, acrobatic, and athletic. They frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and a range of dog sports like dog obedience, disc dog, herding and dog agility. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world and are kept as pets.</p>

        <h3 id="headline">Here are some facts about The Border Collie:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong> Heritage </strong> -Although the Border Collie was bred along the border between Scotland and England, the Border Collie is actually a mix of a Roman herding breed and a Viking Spitz-variety herding breed.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Old Hemp</strong> -Old Hemp was a tricolour dog bred by Adam Telfer in 1983. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure border collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp.

          </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The Eye</strong> -One technique that Border Collies use to herd is called “the eye.” This is an intense stare that intimidates animals. It makes the animals easier for the dog to herd. Even if your Border Collie is not a herder, you may still witness “the eye.” It is common for this breed to try and use it on humans when they want something.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Workaholics</strong> - A workaholic who thrives on mental and physical stimulation, the Border Collie must have a positive way to direct their energy. Otherwise they'll invent his own games and can become a problem to live with.
They will herd anything that moves, including children, cars, people on bikes, cats, and squirrels.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Too smart for their own good</strong> -Border Collies pick up on everything and learn very quickly. This means you need to train them right away before they develop any bad habits, such as barking, nipping, or whining behaviors many border collies default to when they're bored. 
          </li>

            "The Border Collie is the epitome of all we may ever desire in a dog, a friend and a partner. Honesty, integrity and loyalty are second nature to a collie and they will work until they can go no further"
